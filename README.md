## Hi there 🕵🏻‍♂️
Hi, I'm Corinthian. I am a student studying cybersecurity. In my free time I learn about operating system internals, pentesting, malware, mathematics, cryptography, and offensive security. Also a big functional programming nerd.

I like making electronic music, and going to soon start assembling my very own electronic instruments/modular synths.

I am a lover of thinkpads, the grateful dead, the bass, chess, video games, and mtg. I also am an aspiring demoscener, I make demos for modern hardware, the C64, MS-DOS, Atari ST, and Amiga 500/1200. I hope to someday make video games as well.

The main languages I experiment and mess around in are:

- Assembly for x86 and 6502 Architecture, and Microsoft Assembly
- C
- Rust
- Go
- Lua
- Emacs LISP, Common LISP, Scheme, Racket
